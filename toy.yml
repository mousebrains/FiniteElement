# Jan-2020, Pat Welch, pat@mousebrains.com

name: toy # Name of this glider

fluids:
  air: 1.293 # kilograms per cubic meter
  seawater: 1024 # kilograms per cubic meter of seawater

mass: 75 # glider mass in kilograms

geometry: # Components of the geometry
  body:
    shape: cylinder # A right cylinder without ends

    # Frist construct a cylinder along the z axis centered at the origin

    length: 1.8 # meters
    radius: 0.2 # meters

    # Next rotate the cylinder about y from the z-axis to the x-axis
    rotation: [0, 90, 0] # rotation angles in degrees, [yaw, roll, pitch]
                        # yaw/heading is rotation about z
                        # pitch is rotation about y
                        # roll is rotation about x
    
    # Next offset the rotated cylinder
    offset: [0, 0, 0] # offset of midpoint of cylinder in meters

    # Total number of patches is nRadial * nLength
    nRadial: 100 # number of elements in radial dimension
    nLength: 100 # number of elements in length dimension

    qDry: True # Is the volume enclosed dry or wet
